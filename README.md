# Description

In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and operating system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications (Nowadays,[when?] native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues).

In 1995, Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language called JavaScript, allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.[2]


# Task

Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).

Create a class User, it will be your interface in order to

create user
find user
get all users
update user
destroy user in sqlite.
You will use the gem sqlite3. The sqlite filename will be named db.sql.

Your table will be name users and will have multiple attributes:

firstname as string
lastname as string
age as integer
password as string
email as string


# Usage

Create a controller. You will use your User class from Part I. Your route will return a JSON.

It will have multiple routes:

GET on /users. This action will return all users (without their passwords).

POST on /users. Receiving firstname, lastname, age, password and email. It will create a user and store in your database and returns the user created (without password).

POST on /sign_in. Receiving email and password. It will add a session containing the user_id in order to be logged in and returns the user created (without password).

PUT on /users. This action require a user to be logged in. It will receive a new password and will update it. It returns the user created (without password).

DELETE on /sign_out. This action require a user to be logged in. It will sign_out the current user. It returns nothing (code 204 in HTTP).

DELETE on /users. This action require a user to be logged in. It will sign_out the current user and it will destroy the current user. It returns nothing (code 204 in HTTP).

For the signed in method, we will be using session & cookies In order to perform a request with curl and save cookies (Be aware it's not the same flags to save & load)
